# dwi_parcellations
Python scripts for generating connectivity-based parcellations of diffusion data with fsl

For this analysis I used kmeans clustering on the medial prefrontal cortex. The data I used is free-to-use data from the Rockland Sample from the Enhanced Nathan Kline Institute.

This repository contains a folder with preprocessing scripts and another with code for analysis/visualization.
